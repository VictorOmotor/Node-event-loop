  "description": "1. The Event loop allows for asynchronous programming by handling events and callbacks. It also allows for non-blocking asynchronous I/O operations. When an event is triggered, its associated callback function is added to the event queue, and the event loop processes the queue one event at a time, executing the associated callback function for each event.\r 2. \r a. Timers Phase: This phase is where callbacks scheduled by setTimeout(), setInterval() and setImmediate() whose time has expired, are executed.",
